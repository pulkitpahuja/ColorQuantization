Reducing the number of colors in an image Using Principle Component Analysis(PCA)


Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. 

Here PCA and KMeansClustering can be used for image compression that is clustering all the dominant colors into single colors thus
reducing the overall colors and reducing the size of the image.
